The primary objectives of this project include developing a reliable, cost-effective solution that provides professional-grade functionality while remaining accessible to makers and hobbyists. Current market solutions often lack customization options or require expensive proprietary hardware. This implementation leverages open-source technologies and readily available components to create a flexible platform suitable for various applications ranging from kitchen timers to productivity management tools.
