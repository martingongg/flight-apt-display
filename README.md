## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Required

* **Microcontroller:** ESP32-WROOM-32
* **Display:** Any compatible SPI or I2C display (e.g., TFT, OLED)
* **Power Supply:** 5V USB power supply or a 3.3V LiPo battery for portable use.
* **Enclosure:** (Optional) A 3D-printed or project case for protection.

### Why the ESP32?

The **ESP32-WROOM-32** is the optimal choice for this application. Its integrated WiFi, generous memory, and dual-core architecture enable continuous collection, decoding, and visualization of aircraft data without the performance bottlenecks of traditional microcontrollers.

## üöÄ Software Installation & Setup

### 1. Configure Arduino IDE

1.  **Install Arduino IDE:** Download and install the latest version from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2.  **Add ESP32 Board Manager:**
    * Open Arduino IDE and go to `File` > `Preferences` (or `Arduino IDE` > `Settings...` on macOS).
    * In the "Additional boards manager URLs" field, paste the following URL:
        ```
        [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json)
        ```
    * Click "OK".
3.  **Install ESP32 Boards:**
    * Go to `Tools` > `Board` > `Boards Manager...`.
    * Search for "ESP32" and install the package by **Espressif Systems**.
    * After installation, select your specific ESP32 board from the `Tools` > `Board` menu (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module").

### 2. Install Libraries

This project requires several libraries. Install them using the Arduino Library Manager (`Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries...`):

* `WiFi.h`: For connecting to the internet.
* `HTTPClient.h`: For making requests to the flight data API.
* `ArduinoJson.h`: For parsing the JSON data returned by the API.
* A library for your specific display (e.g., `TFT_eSPI` for TFT displays).

### 3. Configure Project Settings

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/flight-apt-display.git](https://github.com/your-username/flight-apt-display.git)
    ```
2.  **Add WiFi Credentials:** Open the main `.ino` file and update the following lines with your network details:
    ```cpp
    const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
    const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
    ```
3.  **Set API Endpoint & Location:** Configure the API URL and your geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude) to fetch flights for your specific area.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Attention to hardware design significantly impacts system reliability. A stable power supply, proper shielding, and good antenna placement are key to creating a robust, professional-grade monitoring solution.

| Issue                  | Symptoms                       | Resolution                                             |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **WiFi Disconnections**| Periodic connectivity loss     | Disable modem sleep; implement reconnection logic.      |
| **Random Resets** | Unexpected reboots             | Increase power supply capacity; add bulk capacitance.  |
| **Display Corruption** | Garbled screen content         | Reduce I2C/SPI speed; improve ground connections.      |
| **Memory Exhaustion** | Crashes after extended operation | Implement memory monitoring; reduce buffer sizes.      |
