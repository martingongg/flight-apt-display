Summary:
This is a simple case, stand, and ESP-32 mount for a 64x64 RGB LED Matrix with a pitch of 2.5mm. This stand is designed with a slight lean-back angle so that it can be placed on a table and easily viewed from most angles. The holes that are in these stands are oval-shaped to ensure that there is flexibility when screwing in the M3 screws to the back of the matrix display and through the casing holes. This ensures that the case and stands can line up as perfectly as possible. There are cutouts in the base of each stand that I initially intended for tungsten cube weights. However, the stands function perfectly well without them, so the weights are optional.
